# üëã <Hi, We are Wutong>
 It's a pleasure that you've noticed us.  
This is an organization that has not yet been established, currently with only the owner as a lone commander.  
## What is ‚ÄúWutong‚Äù?
**This is a concept.**  
We **hope** to create a command-line application that is capable of being a Swiss Army Knife for developers.  
Wutong will become an all-in-one tool that accompanies your coding process.  
## Who created "Wutong"?
It was Gavin. Here is [his GitHub homepage](https://github.com/GavZheng).
Gavin is currently living in Hangzhou, China, in the China Standard Time Zone (UTC+8). You can contact him through the email address gav.zheng@outlook.com.  
## Q&A
- Q1: When can we see Wutong?
- A1: I apologize, but I (Gavin) am not clear about this question either. Perhaps by the end of 2024, we will be able to see a test version of Wutong.
- Q2: What kind of device are you using for development?
- A2: A MacBook Air with the M1 chip.
- Q3: What programming language will Wutong be developed in?
- A3: I (Gavin) initially attempted to develop using Python, but the results were clearly not ideal. Now, I am actively trying to develop Wutong using Rust.

**P.S. This document may have some issues in wording and grammar. The fundamental reason is that the author of the document (Gavin) is not a native English speaker. Therefore, if you find any problems, please help us correct them. Thank you.**
